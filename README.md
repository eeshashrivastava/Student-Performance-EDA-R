# Student Performance Analysis (Synthetic Data)

This project explores academic performance using a synthetic student dataset through exploratory data analysis and Bayesian regression modeling.

## Project Structure
- `01_generate_data.R`: Generates the synthetic dataset
- `02_eda_analysis.Rmd`: Exploratory data analysis and visualizations
- `03_bayesian_modeling.Rmd`: Bayesian regression with posterior predictive checks
- `data/`: Dataset used for analysis
- `plots/`: Exported figures

## Key Findings
- Study time and sleep show the strongest positive associations with GPA
- Screen time and stress are negatively associated with GPA
- Demographic effects are smaller and more uncertain
